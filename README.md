## General Information
- Objective:
- The goal is to to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent and dependent variables.

- Background:
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

The company wants to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. 

- Approach:
- To address the problem statement for BoomBikes, we'll need to perform a detailed analysis of the dataset to understand the factors affecting bike demand. The process involves the following steps:

Data Understanding and Exploration: Examine the dataset to understand the variables and their distributions.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to better capture the relationships in the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the data to identify patterns and relationships.
Modeling: Use statistical and machine learning models to identify significant variables and predict bike demand.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models to ensure they accurately predict bike demand.
Insights and Recommendations: Provide actionable insights based on the analysis to help BoomBikes prepare for the post-pandemic market.

## Conclusions
Based on the analysis and model results, provide actionable insights to BoomBikes. For instance:

Weather Impact: Identify how different weather conditions affect bike demand.
Seasonality: Highlight the peak and off-peak seasons for bike demand.
Feature Importance: Identify the most significant features affecting demand, such as temperature, humidity, or day of the week.
